# HELP: How to use the LaTeX to Readable Text Converter

This program helps you convert LaTeX math text into simple human-readable text.

## HOW TO USE:

1. Run the program (for example, by opening it in a terminal).

2. You will see a menu like this:

   1. Edit text in file (input.txt → output.txt)  
   2. Help

3. Choose option 1.  
   It will open a file called `input.txt`.  

4. Write or paste your LaTeX math text in `input.txt`.  
   For example:  
   \frac{1}{x^2} → will be converted to (¹)/(ₓ²)

5. Save the file `input.txt`.

6. Go back to the terminal.  
   You will now see two new options:

   1. Continue conversion  
   2. Back to menu

7. Choose option 1 to start conversion.  
   The program will create and open a new file `output.txt` with the result.

## EXTRA

- If you need help again, choose option 2 from the main menu.

- This program works with many LaTeX symbols like:  
  \sum, \frac, ^, _, \alpha, \beta, etc.

- The result is easier to read (example: small numbers, subscripts, math symbols).
